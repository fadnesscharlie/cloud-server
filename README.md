## AWS Set UP

Setting up our server in AWS to deploy a NODEJS server to an EC2 instance.

### Application Code

Create your basic file, this will include your html and server. Once you have that, we want to install `express` and `zip`. Once we do that, we can zip that file `zip -r <zip-file-name.zip> *`. 

### Environment

When we are in AWS Elastic Beanstalk, we will create a new environment, and upload our zip file, and now we have our server hosted on AWS.

## AWS EB

[CLI](http://secondtry-env.eba-dbxmcdtp.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

Through AWS EB we can do multiple things to add more. A few of those things include databases, buckets, lambda, etc.

## Notes

AWS is not free! Explore at your own risk, but keep yourself updated on the billing, changes can apply very fast!
